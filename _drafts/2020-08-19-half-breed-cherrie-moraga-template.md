- **Half-Breed by Cherríe Moraga**

  the difference between you and me
  is as I bent
  over strangers’ toilet bowls,
  the face that glared back at me
  in those sedentary waters
  was not my own, but my mother’s
  brown head floating in a pool
  of crystalline whiteness

  she taught me how to clean
  to get down on my hands and knees
  and scrub, not beg
  she taught me how to clean,
  not live in this body

  my reflection has always been
  once removed.
