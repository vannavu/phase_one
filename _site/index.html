<h4>There’s an infinite past… And I come to poetry because I want to write the primary source documents for my mother and I.</h4>
<h5>Paul Tran (<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/149312/vs-ep-31-paul-tran-vs-the-past">source</a>). Paul studied history and has found that poetry (an act of creation) is a way to address the present and expand the histories of Vietnamese Americans that white scholars and writers cannot.</h5>

<p>Before typography came language.</p>

<p>I have been thinking of authorship and what centering history means, as much of it is displayed through individuals and individualized events, objects, etc. when truly we are all an accumulation. What is left unsaid, and therefore eventually forgotten? Yet, the now perpetually becomes the past. Past and future are extended. But why think of past, present, future separately when they exist all at once?</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>It is incredibly powerful to be able to hear queer Vietnamese American creatives and thinkers. It has been hitting me to realize that only contemporaries exist for this perspective, as the Vietnam War ended only 45 years ago. I am part of the precedent.</p>

<p>I wondered why I had a hard time truly taking the advice of older people. Part of it is probably a tendency-to-not-listen-to-adults problem, but also they are fundamentally not me and I am not them. My brothers and I have always learned the hard way, i.e. by doing. It is still a mystery to me the what and how of getting help, when so often it is just a matter of getting me to do what I am thinking. Getting help is often getting validation or some form of permission. When will I entirely be autonomous?</p>

<p>I think I am most autonomous when I make, as thinking and doing synchronize. Then critique and feedback and deadlines are structures for maintaining momentum more than anything.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Still need to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Audre Lorde’s Questionnaire to Oneself</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>What are the words you do not have yet? [<em>Or</em>, “for what do you not have words, yet?”]</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What do you need to say? [List as many things as necessary]</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken and die of them, still in silence? [List as many as necessary today. Then write a new list tomorrow. And the day after.]</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own need for language, ask yourself: “What’s the worst that could happen to me if I tell this truth?” [So, answer this today. And everyday.]</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After looking at these questions again and typing them out, I am realizing that I already am <em>doing</em> a lot of these.</p>

<h2><a href="/2020/08/12/decomposition.html"><span class="post_date">08.12.20</span></a></h2>
<p>Ocean Vuong shared on his Instagram story one poem that changed his life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Fall by Russell Edson</strong></p>

    <p>There was a man who found two leaves and came indoors holding them out saying to his parents that he was a tree.</p>

    <p>To which they said then go into the yard and do not grow in the living room as your roots may ruin the carpet.</p>

    <p>He said I was fooling I am not a tree and he dropped his leaves.</p>

    <p>But his parents said look it is fall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It reminded me of my college admission essay which began with “My mom is trying to create a clone of her idealistic self.” My mother was always telling me to drink more milk so that I would grow taller and have stronger bones, a nagging advice that continued throughout high school. Then I elaborate on my disbelief of Catholicism and consequential performative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_in_the_Catholic_Church">confirmation</a> to appease my unknowing parents. The first time I went to confession was to tell the priest that I was not Catholic. No one really knows how to react to the quiet kid who eventually speaks up to hyperventilate that they reject everything, how to respond to someone who is so vehemently and clearly saying no.</p>

<p>In my essay I see this experience as a rotting piece of my heart decomposing and become fertilizer for the self.</p>

<p>Drinking “Christ’s blood” didn’t teach me anything, but not drinking it did.</p>

<p>I never did drink the milk my mother poured.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I originally wrote the essay for a memoir prompt in an English class taught by Ryan Stripling, a very kind dude who sponsored the literary magazine crew and was one of those life-changing English teachers. He would write a letter to every one of his students at the end of year about how their presence contributed to the classroom, or how they grew, and encouraging how they can grow. He believed that “words create worlds.” I had intended to write a thank you letter after graduating college as I never did in high school. At the end of last year, I went to see what he was up to as I last heard he was writing a book. I found out he just died of cancer in a span of half a year. That was the first time that someone in my life died. I still am hesitant on rushing, but perhaps it is naïve to continue assuming that I have plenty of time. No one knows that.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Paul Tran is another contemporary Vietnamese American poet. A snippet from one of their <a href="http://blogthisrock.blogspot.com/2018/03/split-this-rock-interview-with-paul-tran.html">interviews</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I believe the poet should investigate. Investigation is important to me because our world, as every world before ours, needs thinkers to illuminate the human condition: why are we here and what does it mean for us to be here? What is our purpose and how do we forge, challenge, or resist it? What animates and gives dimension to our desires, dreams, and determination to exact what we think we want by any means necessary? To what lengths would we go to be happy, safe, or satisfied with the shape of our lives and at what costs? Poetry helps us answer these questions. That means, for me, at the heart of every poem is a writer trying to reach for and grapple with a possible or temporary or difficult answer to these questions. Poetry, from this view, is not a “reliving” or “retelling” of events. It is not transcription, as Carl Phillips reminds us. It is transformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For some reason in October 2018, I wrote “Everyone’s got their own voice. I’m not European.” on the back of a handout that was also covered with sketches for typeface idea. I still do not know what I was responding to. I guess all of it really.</p>

<h5>from <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> — Paulo Freire</h5>

<p>I read the above statement back in June after being introduced to the reading via <a href="https://modernitycoloniality.com/">Modernity + Coloniality</a>. The oppressed becoming the oppressors is so common. I want the notion of the oppressed liberating themselves and their oppressors to be true, but it feels so impossible.</p>

<h2><a href="/2020/08/03/teaching-as-a-subversive-activity.html"><span class="post_date">08.03.20</span></a></h2>
<p>I read <em>Teaching as a Subversive Activity</em> by Neil Postman &amp; Charles Weingartner in the last semester of undergrad (about a year and a half ago) after hearing it mentioned in <a href="https://scratchingthesurface.fm/post/180816972790/102-laurel-schwulst">a podcast</a> with <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/">Laurel Schwulst</a>. It is a book students should consider reading (good teachers know they are students as well). I returned to my notes on the book after a friend brought up ideas about pursuing anti-institutional alternatives for design education.</p>

<h4>Children enter school as question marks and leave as periods.</h4>
<h5>From Chapter 5 of <em>Teaching as a Subversive Activity</em></h5>

<p>For a while, I’ve realized, I have been thinking of not approaching design as an essay, to not assert or prove a point or problem solve, but to allow it as a process for exploration and discovering insights. There is a deficiency in learning how to ask questions and what questions to ask. As malleable and not wholly scientific as design is, it is insidious to think that it is a practice of conclusions. Part of the issue lies in having to give designers leverage and validation, but we must admit that we do not know everything. We can post-rationalize til eternity but what are we reasserting by doing that? Why do we have to convince ourselves to such a degree? Is it okay to accept uncertainty, to admit genuinely and not dismissively “I do not know”? What is intuition and “feels right”? Do we assert and create culture or reflect it? Are we humble, or competitive supremacists?</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>I am going to try reading this book again, or at least revisit Chapter 5, titled “What is worth knowing?” as it is asks a series of questions that I answered back in 2019 and would like to answer again now. These are some of the potent questions, along with my answers from March 2019:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>What do you worry about most?</em></p>

    <p>Submitting to capitalist requirements, feeling defeated and meaningless. Building ingenuine networks just for me. Misleading someone. People unable to be independent and secure their own backbone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What are the causes of your worries?</em></p>

    <p>The professionalization of curricula, professors with blasé attitudes who reinforce the client mindset over individual expression. Templated advice that reinforces convention, doesn’t question truth. Lack of depth in relationships. Insecure people with no passion or opinion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What bothers you most about adults? Why?</em></p>

    <p>Those with no opinion or desire to reconsider; they perpetuate conventional systems or hold an authoritarian stance that doesn’t support different perspectives. The neutral are also discouraging; they seem to not care; if they have no exigence, how can you? Ones who don’t go for ideas: stagnant. Those who don’t encourage or push or <em>just fucking care.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What, if anything, seems to you to be worth dying for?</em></p>

    <p>Liberation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How did you come to believe this?</em></p>

    <p>It is easier to fly weightless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>What seems worth living for?</em></p>

    <p>Witnessing where all the good people go and what they do. The growth of deep relationships. The potential of finding a genuine group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How did you come to believe this?</em></p>

    <p>I am getting closer to it every day. The things I make say more than I ever will be able to, as well as the actions of good-willed people. Without them, I would not be here. Each day I am becoming less timid, especially by engaging with people who are bold and honest, but not sensationalists. They are remarkable in the basic desirable traits, which are unfortunately hard to come by. And you can only grow by crossing with new perspectives and accepting support. Hearing of people’s journeys is always a source of optimism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>At the present moment, what would you most like to be doing? Five years from now? Ten years from now? Why? What might you have to do to realize these hopes? What might you have to give up in order to do some or all of these things?</em></p>

    <p>I would like to be loving every minute of school, of making things I’m learning about and engaging in insightful discourse. What I would most like to be focusing on is type design. 5 years from now I hope to be doing type design and related things, or studying it at KABK or elsewhere where I can focus on it in an interdisciplinary way. 10 years from now I hope to be teaching and working in an independent studio, either by myself or with 1 to 2 other people who share similar values but also all bounce off of and push each other. Maybe I will be in a midwest city to continue growing access to type education. I want to do all of these things because type is a beautiful intersection of craft, technical acuity, passion, language, etc. but also because I want to be fueled by others and to fuel others. To do these things I must have independent drive and uncompromising commitment and to a degree, money. I may have to give up either maximal income, securities that large corporations offer, or suspend my beliefs for a little bit. There will be dissonance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="/2020/08/02/post-portfolio.html"><span class="post_date">08.02.20</span></a></h2>
<p>Took a while, but after giving a casual and not well practiced/prepared portfolio share on Zoom yesterday, I was motivated to finish configuring a new reference repository as it’s a really nice way to document interests and thoughts. I included a screenshot from this <a href="https://vannavu.com/referencerepository/week12-13#taeyoon04">2018 entry</a>:</p>

<p><img src="images/2020-08-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is still true.</p>

<p>I start this repository with that as a reminder of non-linearity.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Currently I am in a Display Type class through Type@Cooper. The class is usually in person in NYC, but due to the pandemic it’s online. And because racial injustice has come back to the fore, the instructor was successfully able to fundraise multiple scholarships for BIPOC. So there I am as a non-binary Vietnamese recent first-gen grad sometimes-freelancer grocery store worker from Bentonville, Arkansas who currently lives in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>I am grappling with what this all means. What is my identity? What does it mean to be who I am and to have been enabled to go to a prestigious school via needs-based scholarship and to jump into the design school sans portfolio? To have immigrant conservative parents from the rural South Vietnam, a mother who stopped school at middle school and a father who went through to high school, still chasing the so called American dream, their goals largely influenced by their privileged white Southern customers in their former nail salon? Whererin the strongest genuine tie I have to whatever my perspective of Vietnamese culture is through food? Does it really make sense to mine the visual culture of Vietnam, contemporary and historical, when I am not really part of it? When I was not taught written Vietnamese? When I was naturally drawn to the aesthetics of modernism since youth, ignorant of the manifestos, capitalism, industrialism, colonialism behind it all?</p>

<p>Part of the struggle is how different every Asian American is. And how new Asian America is. There is a history, but do I come from it? Rather I became a part of it the moment I was born. Is it valid to just create and to shape that history now? To not look back since I don’t really come from any of it?</p>

<p>Maybe that all sounds super ignorant. Bentonville, Arkansas is not Vietnamese-American populated like Texas or Cali. The Vietnamese restaurants there end up assimilating to the tastes of Ozarkians: cabin themed, gentrified outdoorsmanship. But what say of me given my education and draw to the modernist works of Europeans? I am not just as white-washed? But what else would I be? The best I can say is that I am just Vanna. An accumulation. Representative of what?</p>

<p>Is existing enough? Must everything be argued? I cannot rationalize the entirety of the self. “I think therefore I am” is a privileged statement.</p>

<p>I was momentarily is a short-term Visual Criticism &amp; Theory class (until realizing I overloaded myself with work, more work, and school), but one of the first exercises we did was writing down how we are privileged and not privileged. It’s not so easily categorized, but dependent on context and who we are in proximity to given the moment. Largely I exist in the middle space, which means a certain level of empathy but also power. I am figuring out how to make the best of that to give leverage to others. So often in the past I simply lead by example, somewhat alone. Asking questions but unsure if anyone else truly pondered them too. I don’t know if continuing to do as that is enough, if sharing is enough. One of my biggest weaknesses is collaboration. Why is that? I also rely on the nicety of others to spread the word about me. I do not assert or market myself really. As I don’t really want to scale or submit myself. I guess that large part of that is that I am super isolated and not part of a community.
Without that there is no horizontality but an insidious amount of individuality.</p>

<p>Well this is what happens when I put off a reference repository. A dam breaks.</p>
