&lt;h6&gt;the movie isn’t animated and it’s from 1985, but these are nice contemporary posters&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a trial on The Criterion Channel to watch &lt;em&gt;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&lt;/em&gt;, I watched &lt;em&gt;Tampopo&lt;/em&gt;, a self-proclaimed “ramen western” (a play on spaghetti western). It was the food movie I’ve been looking for without knowing, a familiar comedic basis with bizarre interludes of people unrelated to the main plot characters and their relationships with food, ranging from uncomfortably erotic to dark-comedy tragic… I don’t even know how to describe all of it. Food is in everyone’s life, in every culture, but its pleasure differs across individuals. One of the first interludes shows a gangster sucking whip cream off his partner’s breast, and the movie ends with credits rolling over a gradual zoom of a baby breastfeeding. It’s a digestible, funny, joyous film but also leaves you kind of thinking, &lt;em&gt;wait, what did I just watch?&lt;/em&gt; And also, &lt;em&gt;dang, I want to eat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="January 2021" /><summary type="html">dude</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I am a grower</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/01/24/i-am-a-grower.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I am a grower" /><published>2021-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/01/24/i-am-a-grower</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/01/24/i-am-a-grower.html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this some time late last year, in November maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meaningful relationships for me involve two growing besides each other. Tension occurs when the other doesn’t grow. Parents stop growing. Childhood friends stuck in hometowns stagnate. It takes time to grow, whether together or apart. To come from roots, trunk, branch, twig. Different branches, different sides of the tree. It mirrors the web of memories. Connected from a distance. I aim to grow toward the sun, while some stay at a certain junction, a certain spot on the tree. Then do we choose to become a seed? A deciduous leaf? A broken branch? A stump?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Currently I am often branching, pivoting elsewhere. But it’s impossible to fly elsewhere. You are rooted in the tree, in all its DNA. Without complete death or complete birth can you become anew. There is no starting over, just moving elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A branching is also not a series of binary switches, but it is a series of choosings. The directions are just infinite. Not yes/no, either/or, N/W/S/E, but more organic and jagged, at each branching and point of mid growth. Shaped like a funnel as well. Tapered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Branches are traceable. They imply changes in decisions, points of decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps one is the whole tree, growing in all directions, but some branches stopping sooner than others. Some must be trimmed. For decomposition and fertilizer. For other people’s wood and warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the issue with straitjackets and stretchers: artificial growth and restraint. How do you care for a tree? Would I rather petrify, be chopped down, or grow forever? Do I have the capacity to be a sequoia?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Flowers have their annual cycles, as I do. When do I bloom? When do I go dormant? Animals have their cycles as well, in coordination with nature. Thinking of the sickly industrialized chickens manipulated by light and feed, confined¹. College is like stunted growth, shortening one’s slaughter date, speed-fattening onself. Prepping for the “real world.” Learrning professionalisms… Fuck. I want to be a free, grass-fed cow. Fish sauce that starts off rotting but eventually becomes aromatic. Filtered. Sun fed². We have the ability to not industrialize ourself. Brand oneself. Slaughter oneself. How else can you care for others?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;¹ clearly just read &lt;em&gt;Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Pollan and &lt;em&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Safran Froer&lt;/h5&gt;

I didn’t plan to do anything. Aside from oversleeping and feeling like shit, I mostly did cultural catch-up in classic Vanna binge fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kung fu movies&lt;/strong&gt; 
 I listened to a Dave Chang Show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2020/9/10/21430393/bad-movie-club-the-last-dragon&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;podcast about &lt;em&gt;The Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a full-blown 80s Black kung fu movie made in homage to Bruce Lee’s &lt;em&gt;Enter the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;. It is unexpectedly comical and subversive. One comment I read afterward about the movie points out how the main character, Leroy Green (aka Bruce Leeroy), is a trained martial artist who doesn’t know how to act while one of his antagonists is a trained actor who doesn’t know martial arts. The other antagonist is an obnoxious, exploitive, wannabe entertainment mogul of a short, balding, gap-toothed white dude. The movie was half produced by Barry Gordy, Motown record label founder. &lt;em&gt;The Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; made me laugh the hardest I’ve laughed all year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In my fascination, I followed up with &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Hustle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ip Man&lt;/em&gt;. Seeing Donnie Yen reminded me of another movie he starred in that I watched a fair bit as a child, &lt;em&gt;The Iron Monkey&lt;/em&gt;. For some reason, one of the most memorable scenes for me is this one:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;responsive_iframe&quot;&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/njcDiwgFTn4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ip Man&lt;/em&gt; introduced me to &lt;em&gt;wing chu&lt;/em&gt;, a defensive and relaxed-looking fighting style. That was the first time I really wished I had learned a martial art.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Part of &lt;em&gt;Ip Man 2&lt;/em&gt; depicts cultural differences in fighting between East and West. One is about earning respect through merit and skill, admitting defeat. The other is about conquering, being the best, justifying brutal violence. Ip Man is asked to give a speech after winning a fight against a psychotic American boxer and says that it is not about who is better but about maintaining the diginity of both sides. I was surprised at the moral messages in a kung fu film, but that’s what half of kung fu is, the philosophy and cultural grounding of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building houses in the Sims &amp;amp; exploring architecture&lt;/strong&gt; 
 I used to draw floor plans for houses in the Sims during free period in high school and considered doing architecture until I job shadowed a firm for two days. Every now and then I get a hankering to play the Sims, mainly to build houses. I watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;Grand Designs&lt;/em&gt; that featured the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archdaily.com/492495/vega-cottage-kolman-boye-architects&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Vega Cottage&lt;/a&gt;, a beautifully simple Norwegian cabin. Its base is carefully carved around the rock it is on top of, and special construction cranes were used to minimize changing the immediate landscape. I was inspired to learn how it was laid out, and the Sims is an accessible tool for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2021-01-16h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Vega Cottage, © Kolman Boye Architects / Lindman Photography&lt;/h6&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I ended up learning about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archdaily.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;archdaily.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;dezeen.com&lt;/a&gt;’s architecture section, which show the floor plans and elevations, and obsessively and restlessly (why do I have to be like this) researched a bunch of houses to study and build.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A house that resonated with me is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archdaily.com/949885/steel-craft-house-zecc-architecten?ad_medium=gallery&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Steel Craft House&lt;/a&gt; designed by Zecc Architecten in Utrecht, The Netherlands:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As described by the architects,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The windows in the new façade all have their own character, anticipating the function that is housed behind them but jointly forms an abstract composition… The ‘bay window’, shaped as a cantilevering enclosed surface at the location of the bathroom, provides for privacy. A small air gap was made at the top.&lt;br /&gt;
 …&lt;br /&gt;
 Behind the hard, occasionally somewhat closed steel façade hides a soft and light residence. The interior is formed by a sculptural piece of ‘furniture’ in oak over three building layers. Extra daylight enters via a patio and several skylights. For instance, the dormer was equipped with a light dome, and in the bathroom, the light enters via a small air gap in the ‘bay window’ of the front façade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The house captures much of my design approach and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I become a librarian or archivist?&lt;/strong&gt; No.
 This nice dude helped me figure that out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC37J30wHpQOtc1vzuN6OdDA&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Stacks &amp;amp; Facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital minimalism &amp;amp; the Light Phone 2&lt;/strong&gt; 
 I was weaning off of Instagram around November, only logging on to see what my brothers were up to. It was sort of pointless having one at this point / I had a hard time controlling my time on it anytime I opened the app. Once my break started, I deactivated and hid the app on my phone. Now it’s completely uninstalled from my phone and I can’t check on my computer without logging on. Similar story with Facebook, which I was only using for shift trades and updates for work. Before these apps, I would watch concerts on YouTube while drawing and crafting. Focused lengths of time vs. the constant fragmenting of my mind. I never really got used to social media. They’re drugs that I didn’t intend to get addicted to. Creating &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Instagram as opposed to sharing things to Instagram I’ve already made is a whole thing. Like I’ve said, do I want to design for squares that maybe get looked at for 5 seconds? Nah brah.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As someone who is already shy, Instagram sort of exacerbates that in a way. It helps to a degree with connecting to people, but not much deeper. It’s a crutch. I don’t know if abandoning it will push me to reach out to people more. It feels a little culturally odd to contact outside of social media with acquaintances. Oh well. I’ve always struggled with friendships that start online anyway. But physical proximity isn’t necessarily the answer either. So what’s to blame is my own ineptude really.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2021-01-16d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelightphone.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;thelightphone.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly how I found out about the Light Phone, but it was somewhat surreal to come across it as a real object that people are using and not a purely hypothetical design. As my brother put it, it’s such a late capitalist product. It’s magnetically appealing, as an object and an ethos. I’m fascinated that this exists and has survived into a second model.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; Entreprenuership is one of my greatest weaknesses. Sure I can think of the new, but building it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Light Phone is an e-ink phone with intentionally limited features, designed for people avoiding privacy breaching smartphones or the app-addicting nature of them. It was designed by Joe Hollier, artist-designer-photographer-what-have-you, and Kaiwei Tang, product designer with prior experience in the phone industry. They met and concepted the idea in a Google Experiential Lab, which Joe entered with high skepticism toward big tech. Despite his supposed caution with tech business, he’s still gone through with the startup and getting investors and venture capitalists on board. Business is still a mystery to me, as is entrepreneurship¹.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the YouTube reviewers of the phone are… interesting — not your average folk as anti-big-tech people can be. They worship the phone for improving their life and enthusiastically hate smartphones. Commentors slam the phone, calling it ridiculous for its price and limited features. It’s polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It launched with only calling, texting, and alarm abilities. Now it also supports music, podcasts, and soon directions, perhaps car sharing, and an SDK so people can accessibly make their own features and tools. The main turnoffs are slow and hard-to-correct texting (being improved) and its $300 pricetag (originally it was $350).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m interested in getting it to see how the limitations change my behavior and partly for having it as a future artifact. The upcoming SDK is intriguing too, but I don’t know if I would truly commit to building my own tools. Financially and practically, not the smartest purchase for me, so I’ve held off and modified my Android to be less stimulating (which by average standards, was already pretty sparse.) Now it looks like this thanks to Before Launcher, dark mode, grayscale, low level blue light filter, and Attribute, the only decent monospace font available on the Galaxy store, which is monopolized by Monotype:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2021-01-16e.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;left swipe (stimuli free notification for non-urgent apps) / home screen / right swipe with more apps hidden in the “+” and “–” folders&lt;/h6&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2021-01-16f.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;I really like how my phone looks now, yet the changes have dampered how much I’m drawn to it (I love color!)&lt;/h6&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2021-01-16g.png#small&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Other font options for maximizing disdain toward your phone&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viet in media&lt;/strong&gt; I found a new podcast called &lt;em&gt;They Call Me Bruce&lt;/em&gt; and they had a pod on a new reality show called &lt;em&gt;House of Ho&lt;/em&gt; which focuses on a wealthy first generation Vietnamese American Catholic family in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m not one for reality TV, but holy shit, I kind of get why people watch the Kardashians and whatnot. I don’t know if they’re relatable to white people, too, but the things that the Ho family are struggling through are in fact relatable, looking past the private jet to go shopping and other frivolties. And as one of the podcasters argued, pop culture is often the first step toward cultural immersion and visibility. It should also be clear, hopefully, to people that a super wealthy immigrant family in Texas doesn’t represent all Vietnamese people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The issues shown in House of Ho: ex-lawyer mother of three going through a divorce who is financially dependent on her parents, learning what it means to act for one’s happiness; immature first-born alcholic son expected to take over the family business who relies on others to do the work for him, protected from his poor decisions in classic, unacknowledged and in denial swept-under-the-rug fashion, expresses love through expensive materialism, vies for the approval of his parents, but eventually makes a small breakthrough upon learning that really, he will never be good enough for his dad; youngest son who keeps his distance from the family and who isn’t afraid to speak up and tell it like it is, doesn’t give in to his parents desires, to their dismay, obviously; wife of the first-born son struggling to manage and change her husband and herself to fit the expectations of her in-laws, comes from a hardworking and traditional Oklahoman household that was in the restaurant business, has a doctorate in pharmacy and works full-time from home, opinionated, respectful and compliant to elders but still stands up for self; problematic yet lovingly free spirited alcholic party aunt; manipulative father who uses money and withheld support and affection as power; standby mother who takes it because it’s the best she can get.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s a lot. As Vietnamese people can be. Now that I think about it, a lot of Vietnamese people are not chill.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In any case, I have found some hardworking and impressive Asian American YouTubers² my age or younger that are on the platform to take advantage of the economic opportunity through a creative means, largely for the sake of paying for college, relating to peers through sharing transparent life and financial advice, talking about taboo subjects, and sharing anxieties. They are willing to for-go a certain amount of privacy, which is perhaps influenced through them coming up with social media, and they intentionally approach brand deals, saying straight up that it’s easy money. They have greater aspirations beyond YouTube. YouTube is a fun and lucrative tool, not something forever. It’s a way for these creators to gain independence and leverage. It’s inspiring, but also worrying. They are completely aware and willing to brand their identity, which can be hard to manage, and compromise with algorithms. If they didn’t have these financial pressures, would they still put themselves out there?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aside from their relatability, entertaining mannerisms, and inspiring self-determination, they actually make you think. They aren’t merely selling a lifestyle or clutter of objects. It’s really cool to watch these people grow as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Aside from oversleeping and feeling like shit, I mostly did cultural catch-up in classic Vanna binge fashion:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Here I was / There I will be / Where am I</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/30/here-we-are.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Here I was / There I will be / Where am I" /><published>2020-12-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-12-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/30/here-we-are</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/30/here-we-are.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/2020-12-30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw this drawing in Venice. I am in Bentonville thinking of Minneapolis. If I had went the other way in my 50/50 of to visit or not visit: there in Minneapolis thinking of Bentonville. But I chose to drink mother’s milk, despite intolerance. Fooled by language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is disturbing to listen then to witness the opposite then to commit the same. What of the who to trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I come from is different from where I came from. I am homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;HOMELESS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here   I was&lt;br /&gt;
There  I will be&lt;br /&gt;
Where  am I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;(&lt;em&gt;repeat&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In feeling homeless, I built a structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to scream but I have no mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard that at work a couple weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you are trying to avoid something rather than to become something, strange things happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;+ full context: Zee speaking in a podcast with David Chang about how in doing everything to avoid the same relationship he had with his father, he ended up having the same relationship with his children&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of Marshall McLuhan’s rear-view mirror syndrome mentioned in &lt;em&gt;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are like drivers whose gaze is fixed not on where we are going but on where we came from&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole lot of nothing til I sit down and write&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Non-industrial pathways:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The tiny iron! And high school lover’s initials, oh boy.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish I did book repair work the summer after graduating. I’m realizing I like doing maintenance work perhaps more than average. Doing all the little things that help everything operate, work, and stay organized. All in balance to the bigger actions. I write a lot of fragments nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="October 2020" /><summary type="html">The tiny iron!

&lt;p&gt;Trading in square pics for a square brush. I understand this brush shape, whereas pointed brushes and pens continue to merely be an inking-in-outlines tools for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a month of work and less so words. In my drafts from earlier this month are &lt;em&gt;nepantla&lt;/em&gt; (in-between-ness), &lt;em&gt;nakasi&lt;/em&gt; (in Taiwanese and Japanese cultures, parlor/bar-accompaniment-music associated with the working class), and thoughts about supremacist perfection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are taught perfection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before design school, one often doesn’t see all the little so-called imperfections. And then you learn how to judge all those details, what’s “right” and “wrong.” What wasn’t distracting before is suddenly an itch. And guess who cares and is aware about those details: not most people. Do we talk about language and communication enough? Formal aspects are easier to talk about, quicker to point out. And then when looking at other people’s work, it becomes easy to dismiss it as unprofessional if a non-crucial detail is a little off. And not just to dismiss&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;em&gt;, but also&lt;/em&gt; the person &lt;em&gt;behind it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfection isn’t the point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of sentiments about freeing oneself and others from perfection. Unpacking what that actionably and perceptively means is subjective. Do I believe in the rules and personally unlived truths I’ve absorbed?&lt;/p&gt;
